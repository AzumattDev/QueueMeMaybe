# Queue Me Maybe

Say goodbye to the frustration of being stuck with the wrong weapon mid-attack with Queue Me Maybe. This mod allows you to queue up weapon changes during attacks, ensuring that your requests to switch weapons won't be ignored.

With Queue Me Maybe, any requests to switch weapons during an attack will be held off until the attack is finished. This allows you to seamlessly transition to a new weapon as soon as the attack is done, ensuring that you always have the right weapon for the job.

Not only will Queue Me Maybe keep you on top of the action, but it also adds a whole new level of strategy to combat. Experiment with different weapon combinations and see how they can be used to create devastating combos.

Installation is a breeze (detailed instructions below) â€“ simply install on each client you wish to have the mod load. And if you ever need help, don't hesitate to reach out to us on Discord. We're always happy to assist.

`This mod is client only, it does not need to be installed on the server.`
